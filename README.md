# tools
First repo under the hipjoiner namespace

These are assorted command-line tools for assorted platforms/operating systems.

which   -- for Windows.  Drives me crazy that Windows doesn't have a linux-style which command, so I wrote one.

ppath   -- cross platform.  Print out path in a neat list rather than one long string.
